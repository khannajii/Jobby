We'll be building an application which contains a chat-bot whose job is to acquire data from the user using  list of questions e.g type of job, preferable location, experience, job role. Then we'll present a set of questions, based on the job profile, to the user to test their eligibility and on the basis of that we'll be short listing candidates for interviews to specific companies. The set of interview questions will be provided by the companies with whom we'll have tie-ups.The app will manage upto 250 users at a time and will be efficient in scheduling an interview within 24 hrs. The webapp can interact in any language including if its broken too e.g hinglish. The target audience is blue collar job candidates such as poor and middle class and jobs such as sales, marketing, or jobs valuing SKILLS OVER DEGREES. Our idea will reduce company work, introduce transparency and normalisation in jobs, and produce more reach.Our app will be interactive so that time and effort of candidate and company is saved.
